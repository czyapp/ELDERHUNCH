## Question 2

### Part (a)

Write assembly-language code to initialise Port B and the SPI circuitry for interfacing with the digital potentiometer chip.

#### Solution

The setup is placed inside a subroutine called `SetupForSpi` that is to be called from elsewhere in the program.

It is assumed that p18f452.inc and configReg.inc have been included at the beginning of the project.

```nasm
SetupForSpi:

  bsf SSPSTAT, CKE  ; tx data on rising edge of SCK
  
  bcf TRISC, RC3  ; configure SCK pin as an output
  bcf TRISC, RC5  ; configure SDO pin as an output
  clrf  LATB  ; initialise Port B by clearing the output data latches
  bcf TRISB, RB3  ; configure RB3 pin as an output (ties to #CS on potentiometer)

  movlw 0x20  ; configuration for SSPCON1 that sets up SPI as: enables serial port and configures SCK and SDO, 
  movwf SSPCON1 ; set the clock idle state as low, spi master mode with FOSC/4 as the input clock, no collision

  return
```

---
### Part (b)

Write an assembly language subroutine **vSetPotBw** that sets the resistance between potentiometer terminals **B** and **W** (wiper) to **N**% of the potentiometer's value. The argument **N** must be an 8-bit unsigned number that is placed in the microcontroller's **W** register before the subroutine is called. Write an assembly language code fragment that calls the subroutine and sets the B-W resistance value to 720 Î©.
